# Lin family fish

This is just a little mod to add some fish to Stardew Valley that my kids (U, R, and K) have designed. 

I'm not an expert modder and this mod will absolutely not change your life, if it even works at all (no guarantees!). But maybe it will be entertaining to look at the fish.

This mod relies on [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/) and [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915). I leaned heavily on reference material from the [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/), notably:

* [Object Data](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Object_data)
* [Location Data](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Location_data)
* [Fish Data](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Fish_data)

Enjoy the fish!
